                <strong>The Therapist did not send a single response until now.</strong><br>
			   Most therapists take less than 10 minutes to send the first response. If it has been over 10 minutes, and the therapist has not responded, we will remind the therapist. Please wait for sometime and if the therapist still doesn't respond, reach out to us.
			   </li>
               <li>
				<strong>The Therapist responded at first, but now he/she is not replying.</strong></strong><br>
			   Generally, at the start of the consultation, the therapist has a dedicated time to respond to you, hence your responses will be quick. It is possible beyond that, the therapist may need to administer urgent care to another user since the online consultation time is quite long as compared to 15-minute consultations in the real world. We request your patience, therapists usually answer as soon as they get free.

                 <li><strong>Why am I not able to ask more questions in my consultation?</strong><br>
			  Your consultation may have ended. You can send 5 free followup messages within 3 days after paid consultation gets over. You may have utilized all the free messages or completed 3 days. Don't worry, if you have asked any questions, you may still get an answer from the Therapist. If there are more questions you need to ask, then we request you to pay and continue the chat with the Therapist.

                                                        <li><strong>The therapist ended the consultation, why?</strong><br> 
			  Just like in a physical consultation, the Therapist has the ability to complete a consultation online. We have seen Therapists usually confirm with their users and then complete the consultation. If this was not the case, and you still have unanswered questions, we suggest you use the free follow-up provided to address the same.

                                                        <li><strong>Why am I not able to ask more questions in my free consultation?</strong><br> 
			  If you were chatting with a Therapist whom you have visited in the clinic, then this chat is a followup feature Therapist is providing. You may have utilized all the free messages in which the Therapist has set or completed the duration of free followup. Don't worry, if you have asked any questions, you may still get an answer from the Therapist. If there are more questions you need to ask, then we request you to pay and continue the chat with the Therapist or reach out to the Therapist.</li>

			  We take our platform policy seriously both for Therapists and users. If you felt that the Therapist's behavior was rude, insensitive or unprofessional, please report this immediately by chatting with us.
			  </li>
              <li>
			  <strong>Is the Therapist qualified?</strong><br> 
			  We take the therapist's verification extremely seriously. We only onboard qualified Therapists onto our platform, post a strict verification process.
              You can be assured the Therapist you’re talking to is exactly who they claim to be. We check the certificate of the Therapist, so you can be 100% sure that your health is in qualified hands.
              </li>
              <li>
			  <strong>I don't agree with Therapist's treatment.</strong><br> 
			  There are multiple ways to treat each health condition. Based on their experience, Therapists can have unique protocols for treating a condition. If you are not certain about the treatment recommended to you, we request you to gently enquire with your Therapist about the same. Generally Therapists are happy to explain and will help you understand.
