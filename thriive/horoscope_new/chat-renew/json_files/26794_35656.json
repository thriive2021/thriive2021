Currently you are asked to strike a balance in your life. I see a lot of chaos in your personal life as well. I see you have walked away from some situation in the past that was very unhealthy (in relationships). Someone here is moving away from a family setup. I see you may have to spend your time alone in the future. Please let me know if this is relatable in any way for you ?\n\n","chat_time":"2021-04-01 12:56:49"}]
